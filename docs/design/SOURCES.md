# Source register, provenance and limits

Initial reconstruction: 2026-09-27. Completeness reviews: 2026-09-29, in
[PR530](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/pull/530), against product baseline
`156a7c043e543b5f4a51fc962d16e31bd6eaa00f`. Sources are the available maintainer
task history, repository source, recent GitHub PR history and local release/handoff
records. The 2026-10-03 port reconciles these historical sources against canonical main
`3f31fce5cd58f3ace204c27e917b85527bfc08c0` and its existing deployment receipts.
The documentation review itself is not a new deployment receipt. No production personal data or private chat images are copied here.

## Source classes

| Source | What it establishes | Limitation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Explicit maintainer messages available during the initial reconstruction and 2026-09-29 reviews | Requirements, corrections, scoped approvals and stop instructions. | Not a public verbatim archive; summaries preserve intent without unrelated private conversation. |
| Current canonical main 3f31fce5; historical review 156a7c04; initial reconstruction fd290b5e | Reviewed implementation and merged PR ancestry; pending PR528/529 are documented separately. | Current behavior is not proof of original rationale or full legacy parity. |
| Initial PR425–524 listing, followed by PR525–530 source/status review | Recent sequence of fixes and superseded/pending state. | Titles alone do not prove test execution; important outcomes use source/work-log evidence. |
| Work log and recorded release receipts | Prior verification and deployment outcomes with stated scope. | Some full artifacts remain operator-local; transfer/revalidate as documented. |
| Backend source reference and contracts handoffs | Exact endpoint incompatibilities and proposal boundaries. | Independent API pin; not permission to change upstream/shared runtime. |
| KB contracts work/handoffs | Real isolated scenario history, independent pins and remaining KB work. | Not a completed production KB publication or certification of another UI/API pair. |
| Existing docs/spec and docs/chat | Historical archaeology. | Many pages are quarantined stubs or stale; not current authority. |
| Upstream `Kerrycek/clankerdev` commit `e7ce3d73e799fc60e5933fe23bdb3a979eb4d6b9` | Source history and the repository-contained redesign index adopted by `vpsfreecz/vpsadmin-webui`. | Importing source does not transfer old-host deployment state or certify the new service. |

## Recoverable maintainer requests

The requirements register captures the available concrete requests for:

- API filter/cursor correctness, adversarial multipage tests and owner scope;
- isolated real workflow proof, KB navigation/articles/captures and release criteria;
- user/admin product views, scoped backend work and preservation of shared data;
- effective timezone, allocation overrides, node heatmaps and resource workspace;
- route focus outline removal and technical metadata visible during review;
- repeated corrections to registration layout, risk placement, decisions and resolved-state actions;
- VPS distribution/runtime summary, header presentation and equal overview cards;
- real session countdown, persistent theme, direct console entry and deletion modes/feedback;
- icon-only heatmap actions, understandable sidebar icons/labels, legacy favicon;
- ongoing work log and complete English repository design/requirements documentation;
- scoped merge/deploy requests and the later stop of scheduled autonomous work;
- migration destination dropdown suitable for dozens of nodes, with reason/options visible;
- editable rejection/correction presets in the applicant’s language, including custom text;
- issue automation restricted to Kerrycek and active vpsfreecz members, with outside approval;
- selected newadmin.vpsfree.cz hostname, dedicated deployment identity and separate personal access.

These later accepted details are recorded in REQ-028/038/063/066 and their linked
contracts/decisions; accepted intent must not be confused with deployed behavior.

The explicit later choice of newadmin.vpsfree.cz supersedes the informal naming
discussion. The subsequent [three-site receipt](../work-log/2026-09-30-three-site-release.md)
records deployed parallel previews; default-interface cutover and authenticated
acceptance are separate. Independent-audit
discussion does not appoint a reviewer or approve beta publication.
No requirement is inferred from irrelevant personal text in attached conversations.

## Missing or intentionally bounded evidence

The formerly referenced sibling UI_REDESIGN.md was absent in the searched workspace.
Its contents have not been invented. Earlier task conversations not available here
may contain additional requirements. Record them as recovered additions with source
and status; do not silently claim this register covers inaccessible history.

The generated inventory covers every declared route and API adapter in this
checkout. It does not derive every business rule from backend code or certify every
legacy field/action. Source-derived domain preservation expectations are marked C
in the register. A maintainer/legacy expert should review gaps against actual duties.

A full independent audit, final exact-candidate lifecycle certification, finalized
KB publication, transfer of private operator evidence, and assigned handover owners
remain open. Those are honest limits of this documentation, not reasons to keep
future requirements outside version control.
