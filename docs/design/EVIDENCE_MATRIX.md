# Requirement evidence matrix

Review baseline: UI/BFF `3f31fce5cd58f3ace204c27e917b85527bfc08c0`, 2026-10-03.
This maps **all 71 register IDs**, including policy/non-runtime requirements. A
verification entry is a reproducible review starting point, **not** proof that
all acceptance criteria passed. A source link is not a test and a fixture does
not establish API behavior. For broad requirements use the linked action catalog
and the additional cases below, not just one representative test.

Implementation and historical delivery are recorded in [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).
Detailed current behavior is in [ACTION_CONTRACTS.md](ACTION_CONTRACTS.md).
Fresh commands and results for this documentation change are in its
[port work log](../work-log/2026-10-03-documentation-port.md). Historical whole-suite
counts must not be relabeled fresh tests of this branch. Historical pre-transfer main
release CI is [static](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/actions/runs/36342559547)
and [fixture browser](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/actions/runs/36342559546).
Not every test file in this matrix necessarily ran in that PR-selected browser run.

## Critical acceptance cases

Use these exact case titles/selectors to find the expected assertion, then check
that the scenario still matches the changed API/UI. Fixture names containing
"live contract" still use intercepted responses unless explicitly run against a
real pinned API. Each live proof must include owner/role, UI/API pins, outcome
and cleanup. Ongoing policy rows are reviewed manually rather than forced into
meaningless tests.

## Historical pending-branch evidence

These are the original repository runs, not results for the canonical ports.
PR529 is now [canonical PR9](https://github.com/vpsfreecz/vpsadmin-webui/pull/9);
PR528 is [canonical PR12](https://github.com/vpsfreecz/vpsadmin-webui/pull/12),
based on PR10.
Current port receipts are linked from the work-log index.

- **PR528**, `94784cf4c93253bc8996f7b15b8dbfe3e96b0899`:
  [static CI](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/actions/runs/36359596240),
  [browser CI](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/actions/runs/36359596147).
  Its migration tests cover 60 destinations, bounded dropdown/search, keyboard,
  retained selection, payloads and errors. Fixture proof only; no live migration.
- **PR529**, `169ad7fac8d8daab8d6d96d1e561dd2877915f0e`:
  [static CI](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/actions/runs/36358609408),
  [browser CI](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/actions/runs/36358609409).
  Preset tests cover reason bodies, editable/custom text, language resolution and
  submitted payload in cs/en. No email was actually delivered by these tests.
- **PR496/507/509**: do not treat green fixture CI as resolution of backend ordering.
  Their integration needs a newly agreed API pin and adversarial multi-page proof.

## Evidence transfer and retention

For each actual live scenario, store a sanitized receipt containing: scenario ID,
exact UI/API pins, date, role, locale/viewport, synthetic-object provenance,
command/test revision, accepted operation ID, final state and cleanup outcome.
Do not publish cookies, tokens, real applicant data or raw private traces.

The receiving operator must get access to the restricted artifact archive and
verify hashes/retention with its custodian. Prior private VM evidence is not
silently certified here; [HANDOVER.md](HANDOVER.md) names the transfer tasks and
explicitly unassigned owners. Test links remain useful even if an old CI artifact
has expired, but a reproducible test is not a replacement for a claimed past run.
