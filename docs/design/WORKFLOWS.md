# Workflow catalog and behavior to preserve

This catalog covers all product domains in the current route/API inventory. It is
not a claim of exhaustive field-level legacy parity. Each workflow inherits the
role/scope, localization, focus, draft/error and uncertain-write rules from
[product design](PRODUCT_DESIGN.md) and [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md).

Source links identify implementation for inspection, not a substitute for test
results. Every endpoint field remains governed by [API contracts](API_CONTRACTS.md).
The [generated inventory](IMPLEMENTATION_INVENTORY.md) covers exact route variants,
layouts, aliases and imported finance/advisory gates.

## Public entry and authentication

**Intent:** inspect service availability, sign in, recover access or correct a
registration without exposing private information. Public overview combines
cluster/node status with outages/news/advisories; external heatmaps are optional.
OAuth login/callback/logout preserve a safe return destination and display errors.
Password recovery uses the configured provider flow. Token-scoped registration
correction exposes only the request allowed by that token.

**Failure contract:** public API failure is not “all healthy”; unavailable heatmaps
must not break node lists. Auth callback errors offer a way back. Expiry redirects
preserve safe navigation context and do not loop. Check session JSON separately
from SPA fallback. The production frontend requires valid BFF configuration and
session JSON before mounting. Missing, redirected, malformed, oversized or
stalled responses show an early bilingual error with a retry; no stored
standalone token is restored. An anonymous BFF result clears old standalone
and impersonation credentials. Retry repeats only the two bootstrap GETs, not
an API mutation. [Routes](../../src/routes/router.tsx),
[public adapter](../../src/lib/api/public.ts), [BFF docs](../../bff/README.md).

## VPS creation, detail and power

**Intent:** choose placement/template/resources, create a VPS, inspect identity and
runtime status, and manage it. Creation defaults are suggestions; async updates
cannot overwrite entered resources. Member scope stays owned; admins can explicitly
use the appropriate wider view. Header distribution/runtime facts and equal-width
cards make common diagnostics available without a second screen.

After an accepted create response, open the exact VPS detail immediately while
provisioning continues. A localized banner distinguishes accepted/pending work,
confirmed completion, task failure and unavailable status; it links to Tasks
without opening the Tasks panel over the detail automatically. Fetch the detail
while work runs and refresh it on completion. If the API cannot yet serialize
the new VPS, retain its accepted ID and progress instead of showing only a
spinner. Creation locks still block conflicting mutations, including after reload.
The administrator's originating member filter stays in the detail URL. Missing
receipts or transport loss remain uncertain and must not trigger a blind retry.

**Actions:** start, graceful shutdown, immediate poweroff, restart and supported
power/lifecycle operations must name the target and honor live state/transaction
locks. Shutdown and poweroff use the same stop request with distinct force values.
Creation and power requests may
be asynchronous. Preserve action-state links and reconcile uncertain submissions
before a second attempt. [VPS adapter](../../src/lib/api/vps.ts),
[power failure fixture](../../e2e/specs/app/vps_power_failures.spec.ts).

## Compute, disk, access, network and maintenance

**Intent:** edit compute and root disk in a coherent workspace, configure hostname,
access, features, interfaces and supported maintenance actions. Compute and dataset
changes have separate backend boundaries: do not promise an atomic combined save.
Admin allocation overrides are explicit and never silently enabled for members.

**Failure contract:** retain reviewed values and identify which operation failed.
Refresh affected facts after known acceptance, but do not reset unrelated input.
Role/state restrictions remain on direct routes. Root usage/quota checks and server
validation determine allowed shrinking/growing; the UI does not manufacture free
resources. [Access](../../src/lib/api/vpsAccess.ts),
[features](../../src/lib/api/vpsFeatures.ts), [mounts](../../src/lib/api/vpsMounts.ts),
[maintenance](../../src/lib/api/vpsMaintenance.ts),
[resource fixture](../../e2e/specs/app/vps_resource_workspace.spec.ts).

## Console and VPS deletion

**Intent:** entering Console opens a session directly; intentional replacement and
revocation remain explicit. Opening a page must not spawn an uncontrolled retry
loop after a failed token request. Secure console URLs are required.

Deletion separates standard member removal from admin soft/hard options and
optional custom retention. Review target and mode; show a durable accepted-request
receipt and Tasks link. An accepted request may still fail later. Hard mode cannot
accidentally inherit a soft expiry. Dev's missing default retention remains a
backend configuration decision. [Console fixture](../../e2e/specs/app/vps_console_page.spec.ts),
[PR518](https://github.com/Kerrycek/clankerdev/pull/518).

## Storage, NAS, snapshots, backup and export

**Intent:** inspect datasets and usage/quota, create NAS storage, manage snapshots,
schedules/plans and downloads, export datasets and restore from available backups.
VPS root disks remain in VPS detail; member NAS and Backup Center retain separate
navigation. Backup filters remain stable across tab changes.

**Restore contract:** identify source snapshot/pool and destination; distinguish
local from replicated/remote restore. Track transfer/restore chains to an actual
outcome before calling the data recovered. Live evidence needs synthetic content
and cleanup, not only a completed UI task. Download/export URLs and permissions
must not leak to unrelated owners. Snapshot/list pagination retains the documented
backend blocker. [Datasets](../../src/lib/api/datasets.ts),
[exports](../../src/lib/api/exports.ts), [backup fixture](../../e2e/specs/app/backup_center.spec.ts).

## DNS and networking

**Intent:** create/edit zones and records, configure transfers, servers, TSIG and
DNSSEC, inspect logs, and manage relevant IP/interface/resolver resources.
Administrators also have network/address inventories and allocation operations.

**Success contract:** UI save and DNS publication are separate evidence. Real
publication tests query the actual isolated DNS service after the transaction.
Respect supported record types, TTL and payload fields; preserve zone context on
errors. Secret-bearing keys must be scrubbed from diagnostics. IP assignment
history must not lose entries due to a false cursor assumption.
[DNS](../../src/lib/api/dns.ts), [transfers](../../src/lib/api/dnsTransfers.ts),
[interfaces](../../src/lib/api/networkInterfaces.ts), [IP history](../../src/lib/api/ipAddresses.ts).

## Account profile and user administration

**Intent:** members manage profile, mail/security preferences, keys, sessions, MFA,
metrics, user-data and namespaces. Administrators inspect/update users, resource
usage/packages, environment configuration, finances and account states as allowed.
Effective timezone is explicit. User login/timezone/filesystem-related legacy
controls must not disappear during layout simplification.

**Risk contract:** distinguish security-sensitive changes from ordinary preferences;
confirm disabling MFA/deleting keys/sessions, preserve failures, never log secrets.
Passkey setup belongs to the authentication origin. Profile edits may create a
review request rather than directly change the account; the receipt/status must
explain that. [Users](../../src/lib/api/users.ts),
[user accounts](../../src/lib/api/userAccounts.ts), [namespaces](../../src/lib/api/userNamespaces.ts),
[user-data](../../src/lib/api/vpsUserData.ts).

## Applications, profile changes and review queues

**Intent:** inspect a request's applicant data, technical metadata and risk checks,
then approve, reject with a response, close without response or request correction
where the API state permits. A queue can start from the selected item; moving to
the next item is controlled by the compact preference. Resolved registrations can
be reconsidered through supported transitions, not an arbitrary status picker.

**Failure contract:** preserve the current decision draft, stale/missing owner
errors, and uncertain-operation guard. Already-created accounts/terminal states
must not be duplicated. Test persisted backend state and notification/action-state
outcome with synthetic accounts before claiming full lifecycle certification.
[Request model](../../src/pages/app/admin/RequestDetailModel.ts),
[resolution mutation](../../src/pages/app/admin/RequestResolveMutation.ts),
[requests API](../../src/lib/api/requests.ts).

## Payments and finance

**Intent:** members inspect their payments; admins assign/review incoming payments,
manage account-related finance, history and forecasts. The Finance menu opens
incoming payments as the common working destination. Global finance and sensitive
user payment views have explicit administrator gates even if a support-level user
can access other admin pages.

**Failure contract:** amounts/currency/timezone/scope must stay bound to the reviewed
transaction. Failed assignment remains in review; queue advances only on the known
appropriate outcome. Partial/bulk outcomes require reconciliation rather than
blind retry. [Finance](../../src/lib/api/finance.ts),
[payments](../../src/lib/api/payments.ts), [gated routes](../../src/routes/adminFinanceRoutes.tsx).

## Tasks, transactions, monitoring, incidents and OOM

**Intent:** inspect asynchronous action states/chains/items, monitoring events,
incident reports and memory-exhaustion reports/rules/tasks/stats. These explain
why an object is busy and whether an operation succeeded.

**Contract:** action state, transaction and object state are related but not
interchangeable. Unknown/stale locks must be shown as such. Users see permitted
objects; session filters and pagination must retain context. Large cgroup/SSH/task
identifiers must wrap or scroll appropriately on mobile. Monitoring decisions and
incident creation keep failed submissions retryable where safe.
[Transactions](../../src/lib/api/transactions.ts),
[monitoring](../../src/lib/api/monitoring.ts), [incidents](../../src/lib/api/incidents.ts),
[OOM](../../src/lib/api/oom.ts).

## Nodes, cluster and migrations

**Intent:** inspect node status, kernel/system history and configured versions;
admins manage node/cluster/network/resource settings and migration plans.
Heatmap availability follows legacy config/type/maintenance rules. Expose useful
member visibility without granting infrastructure writes.

**Failure contract:** edits/actions bind target, state and permission; mutations
return tracked results and retain errors. A node route being present is not proof
that every action is allowed for support/member roles. History cursors and status
sampling intervals need their real API semantics.
[Nodes](../../src/lib/api/nodes.ts), [history](../../src/lib/api/nodeHistory.ts),
[cluster](../../src/lib/api/cluster.ts), [migrations](../../src/lib/api/migrations.ts).

## Security advisories, audit, mail and content

**Intent:** members/public read applicable advisories; admins manage advisories,
updates, relations and associated outages/rebuilds. Audit history supports
operational investigation. Mail administration covers templates/translations,
mailboxes/handlers, recipients and delivery logs. Content includes news and
contextual help boxes.

**Failure contract:** privileged routes/actions remain independently gated; template
HTML preview must retain sandbox/remote-load defenses. Handler reorder partial
outcomes require reconciliation. Keep row/form errors where the edit happened.
Publication/email side effects require the actual requested scope, not incidental
permission to prepare documentation.
[Advisories](../../src/lib/api/securityAdvisories.ts), [audit](../../src/lib/api/audit.ts),
[mailer](../../src/lib/api/mailer.ts), [help boxes](../../src/lib/api/helpBoxes.ts).

## KB integration and documentation

**Intent:** maintain real navigation/page bindings, selected articles and usable
cs/en screenshots for the new UI, without replacing old evidence prematurely.
The separate KB repository pins UI and API independently, starts its owned test
cluster and uses real login/navigation on synthetic data. Fixture screenshots are
valuable layout proof but not KB live-capture proof.

**Contract:** semantic IDs/fingerprints follow changed routes/labels; screenshots
exclude real people, tokens and recovery material. Record receipts and avoid
repeating completed mutations. Production KB publication and transition strategy
remain separate approval/ownership decisions. [KB repository](https://github.com/vpsfreecz/vpsfree-kb-contracts),
[verification gates](VERIFICATION.md).
