# vpsAdmin WebUI Next

Modern responsive web UI replacing the legacy PHP webui.

## Canonical spec

The source release was imported from the WebUI Next deployment that produced
the current `clankerdev.vpsfree.cz` build. The project notes live in `SPEC.md`
and `docs/`.

## Development

Node.js **^20.19.0, ^22.12.0, or >=24.0.0** required.

Recommended local baseline: **22.12.0+** on the 22.x LTS line.

```bash
npm ci
npm run env:check
npm run dev
```

## E2E smoke tests

```bash
# one-time browser install
npm run e2e:install

# same Playwright smoke set used for pull-request feedback
npm run e2e:pr
```

The default Playwright suite uses deterministic HaveAPI mocks and does not require real login credentials.
